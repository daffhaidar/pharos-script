# THIS FILE TELLS GIT WHICH FILES/FOLDERS TO IGNORE IN YOUR PROJECT
# =============================================================================

# 1. Dependencies & Tools (MUST BE IGNORED)
# Contains thousands of small files, makes repo very heavy
node_modules/
package-lock.json

# 2. Secrets & Private Keys (MUST BE IGNORED!)
# NEVER UPLOAD THESE TO GITHUB! VERY DANGEROUS!
.env
*.env
keys.json
secrets.json
credentials.json

# 3. Temporary Files & Logs (Not Important)
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo
.DS_Store

# 4. Hardhat Generated Files (EXCEPT ARTIFACTS)
# These are temporary files created by Hardhat, no need to upload
/cache
/typechain
/typechain-types
/coverage
/coverage.json
/ignition/deployments/chain-31337

# /artifacts folder is INTENTIONALLY NOT IGNORED, so new users
# don't need to run 'npx hardhat compile'. They can use it directly.
